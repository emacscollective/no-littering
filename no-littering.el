;;; Commentary:

;; Help keeping ~/.emacs.d clean.

;; The default paths used to store configuration files and persistent
;; data are not consistent across Emacs packages.  This isn't just a
;; problem with third-party packages but even with built-in packages.

;; Some packages put these files directly in `user-emacs-directory'
;; or $HOME or in a subdirectory of either of the two or elsewhere.
;; Furthermore sometimes file names are used that don't provide any
;; insight into what package might have created them.

;; This package sets out to fix this by changing the values of path
;; variables to put files in either `no-littering-etc-directory'
;; (defaulting to "~/.emacs.d/etc/") or `no-littering-var-directory'
;; (defaulting to "~/.emacs.d/var/"), and by using descriptive file
;; names and subdirectories when appropriate.  This is similar to a
;; color-theme; a "path-theme" if you will.

;; We still have a long way to go until most built-in and many third-
;; party path variables are properly "themed".  Like a color-theme,
;; this package depends on user contributions to accomplish decent
;; coverage.  Pull requests are highly welcome (but please follow the
;; conventions described below and in the pull request template).

;; Usage:

;; Load the feature `no-littering' as early as possible in your init
;; file.  Make sure you load it at least before you change any path
;; variables using some other method.
;;
;;   (require 'no-littering)

;; If you would like to use base directories different from what
;; `no-littering' uses by default, then you have to set the respective
;; variables before loading the feature.
;;
;;   (setq no-littering-etc-directory
;;         (expand-file-name "config/" user-emacs-directory))
;;   (setq no-littering-var-directory
;;         (expand-file-name "data/" user-emacs-directory))
;;   (require 'no-littering)

;; Conventions:

;; * A) File names
;;
;; 1. File names are based on the name of the respective Emacs Lisp
;;    variables and the name of the respective Emacs package.
;;
;; 2. The name of the respective Emacs package should serve as the
;;    prefix of the file name, unless the file is in a subdirectory in
;;    which case the name of the subdirectory serves as the prefix.
;;
;; 3. If the name of the package and the prefix of the variable do not
;;    match, then we prefer the name of the package.
;;
;; 4. If the name of a path variable ends with `-file`, `-default-file`,
;;    `-directory`, `-default-directory`, or something similar, then that
;;    suffix is usually dropped from the file name.
;;
;; 5. If applicable, the appropriate extension is added to the file name
;;    so that files are visited using the appropriate major-modes and
;;    also to provide a hint about the kind of data stored in the file.
;;    E.g.  if a file contains an S-expression, then the suffix should be
;;    `*.el`.

;; * B) File location and subdirectories
;;
;; 1. If a package has only one data file, then that is usually placed in
;;    `no-littering-var-directory` itself.  Likewise if a package has
;;    only one config file, then that is placed in
;;    `no-littering-etc-directory` itself.
;;
;; 2. If a package has multiple data (or config files), then those files
;;    are placed in a subdirectory of `no-littering-var-directory` (or
;;    `no-littering-etc-directory`).
;;
;; 3. If a subdirectory is used for a package's data (or config) file
;;    variables, then the name of the directory should match the name of
;;    the package in most cases.  The subdirectory name may serve as the
;;    package prefix of the file name.
;;
;; 4. If a package provides a "framework" for other packages to use,
;;    then we may reuse its directories for other packages that make use
;;    of that framework or otherwise "extend" the "main package".
;;    E.g. we place all `helm` related files in `helm/`.
;;
;; 5. If a package only defines a single variable that specifies a data
;;    (or config) directory, then the directory name should
;;    nevertheless be just the package name.  E.g. the path used for
;;    `sx-cache-directory` from the `sx` package is `sx/cache/`, not
;;    `sx-cache/`.
;;
;; 6. However if the name of the directory variable implies that the
;;    package won't ever define any data (or config) files that won't be
;;    placed in that directory, then we use a top-level directory.  E.g.
;;    when the name of the variable is `<package>-directory`, in which
;;    case we would use just `<package>/` as the path.

;; * C) Ordering and alignment
;;
;; 1. The code that sets the values of themed variables is split into two
;;    groups.  The first group sets the value of variables that belong to
;;    packages that are part of Emacs, and the second group is used for
;;    variables that are defined by packages that are not part of Emacs.
;;
;; 2. Each of these lists is sorted alphabetically (usually by variable
;;    name).  Please keep it that way.
;;
;; 3. We attempt to align the value forms inside different `setq` forms.
;;    If the symbol part for a particular variable is too long to allow
;;    doing so, then don't worry about it and just break the alignment.
;;    If it turns out that this happens very often, then we will adjust
;;    the alignment eventually.

;; * D) Commit messages
;;
;; 1. Please theme each package using a separate commit and use commit
;;    messages of the form "<package>: theme <variable".
;;
;; 2. If a package has several path variables, then you should theme them
;;    all in one commit.
;;
;; 3. If the variable names do not fit nicely on the summary line, then
;;    use a message such as:
;;
;;      foo: theme variables
;;
;;      Theme `foo-config-file', `foo-cache-directory',
;;      and `foo-persistent-file'.
;; 4. When appropriate add statements like the following to the commit
;;    message:
;;
;;    - This file is used to store an s-expression.
;;    - This file is used to store raw text.
;;    - This is the only configuration/data file of the package.
;;    - This package does/doesn't take care of creating the containing
;;      directory if necessary. (If the package does not do it, then you
;;      should also fix that and submit an upstream pull request.)
;;
;; 5. If you are uncertain, then be explicit about it by adding a comment
;;    to the pull-request.
