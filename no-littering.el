;;; Commentary:

;; Help keeping ~/.emacs.d clean.

;; The default paths used to store configuration files and persistent
;; data are not consistent across Emacs packages.  This isn't just a
;; problem with third-party packages but even with built-in packages.

;; Some packages put these files directly in `user-emacs-directory'
;; or $HOME or in a subdirectory of either of the two or elsewhere.
;; Furthermore sometimes file names are used that don't provide any
;; insight into what package might have created them.

;; This package sets out to fix this by changing the values of path
;; variables to put files in either `no-littering-etc-directory'
;; (defaulting to "~/.emacs.d/etc/") or `no-littering-var-directory'
;; (defaulting to "~/.emacs.d/var/"), and by using descriptive file
;; names and subdirectories when appropriate.  This is similar to a
;; color-theme; a "path-theme" if you will.

;; We still have a long way to go until most built-in and many third-
;; party path variables are properly "themed".  Like a color-theme,
;; this package depends on user contributions to accomplish decent
;; coverage.  Pull requests are highly welcome.

;; Usage:

;; Load the feature `no-littering' as early as possible in your init
;; file.  Make sure you load it at least before you change any path
;; variables using some other method.
;;
;;   (require 'no-littering)

;; If you would like to use base directories different from what
;; `no-littering' uses by default, then you have to set the respective
;; variables before loading the feature.
