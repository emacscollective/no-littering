;; Help keeping ~/.emacs.d clean.

;; The default paths used to store configuration files and persistent
;; data are not consistent across Emacs packages.  This isn't just a
;; problem with third-party packages but even with built-in packages.

;; Some packages put these files directly in `user-emacs-directory'
;; or $HOME or in a subdirectory of either of the two or elsewhere.
;; Furthermore sometimes file names are used that don't provide any
;; insight into what package might have created them.

;; This package sets out to fix this by changing the values of path
;; variables to put files in either `no-littering-etc-directory'
;; (defaulting to "~/.emacs.d/etc/") or `no-littering-var-directory'
;; (defaulting to "~/.emacs.d/var/"), and by using descriptive file
;; names and subdirectories when appropriate.  This is similar to a
;; color-theme; a "path-theme" if you will.

;; We still have a long way to go until most built-in and many third-
;; party path variables are properly "themed".  Like a color-theme,
;; this package depends on user contributions to accomplish decent
;; coverage.  Pull requests are highly welcome.

;; Usage:

;; Load the feature `no-littering' as early as possible in your init
;; file.  Make sure you load it at least before you change any path
;; variables using some other method.
;;
;;   (require 'no-littering)

;; If you would like to use base directories different from what
;; `no-littering' uses by default, then you have to set the respective
;; variables before loading the feature.
;;
;;   (setq no-littering-etc-directory
;;         (expand-file-name "config/" user-emacs-directory))
;;   (setq no-littering-var-directory
;;         (expand-file-name "data/" user-emacs-directory))
;;   (require 'no-littering)

;; Conventions:

;; * File names
;;
;; If a package has only one persistent data file, then that is placed
;; in `no-littering-var-directory' itself.  If a package has multiple
;; files, then they are placed in a subdirectory, whose file name is
;; the name of the package.  Likewise for a package's configuration
;; files.
;;
;; Additonally a file name should:
;;
;; 1. Share the prefix of the package that uses it.  For files that
;;    are located in a a subdirectory, the name of the directory counts
;;    as the prefix.
;;
;; 2. Reflect the name of the elisp variable that references it.  If
;;    you only know the name of the file, it should be trivial to find
;;    the variable that references that file in Emacs (e.g. to find
;;    its documentation).
;;
;; 3. Use appropriate extensions (if applicable) to signal the content
;;    of the file and to trigger the correct major-mode.

;; * Ordering and alignment
;;
;; The code that sets the values of themed variables is split into two
;; groups.  The first group sets the value of variables that belong to
;; packages that are part of Emacs, and the second group is used for
;; variables that are defined by packages that are not part of Emacs.
;; Each of these lists is sorted alphabetically.  Please keep it that
;; way.
;;
;; We attempt to align the value forms inside different `setq' forms.
;; If the symbol part for a particular variable is too long to allow
;; doing so, then don't worry about it and just break the alignment.
;; If it turns out that this happens very often, then we will adjust
;; the alignment eventually.

;; * Commit messages
;;
;; Please theme each package using a separate commit and use commit
;; messages of the form "<package>: theme <variable".  If a package
;; has several path variables, then you should theme them all in one
;; commit.  If the variable names do not fit nicely on the summary
;; line, then use a message such as:
;;
;;   foo: theme variables
;;
;;   Theme `foo-config-file', `foo-cache-directory',
;;   and `foo-persistent-file'.
